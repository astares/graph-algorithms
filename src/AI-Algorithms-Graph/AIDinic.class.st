Dinic's algorithm is a graph algorithm used to solve the maximum flow problem efficiently. It is an improvement over the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm and is based on the concept of layering in the residual graph.

Here's a summary of Dinic's algorithm:

- Start with an initial flow of zero and create the residual graph from the given network.

- Construct a level graph using breadth-first search (BFS) on the residual graph. The level graph assigns levels or distances to each vertex, indicating the shortest path from the source.

- While there exists an augmenting path (a path from the source to the sink in the level graph), do the following steps:

	a. Use depth-first search (DFS) to find a blocking flow along the augmenting path. This flow is 		the maximum amount of flow that can be sent through the path.

	b. Update the residual graph by subtracting the blocking flow from forward edges and adding it to 		backward edges.

- Finally, the maximum flow is obtained by summing up the flows on all outgoing edges from the source.

Dinic's algorithm is efficient due to the concept of layering. The algorithm increases the flow in the network by finding multiple disjoint augmenting paths in each iteration, resulting in faster convergence compared to the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm.

The time complexity of Dinic's algorithm is O(V^2E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges. However, with the use of advanced data structures like dynamic trees, the time complexity can be improved to O(V^2E log(V)).

Overall, Dinic's algorithm is a powerful method for solving the maximum flow problem, particularly for large-scale networks.

Here's an example code snippet to run the Dinic's Algorithm:

|nodes edges dinic value|

nodes := #( $1 $2 $3 $4 $5 $6 ).
edges := #( #( $1 $2 10 ) #( $1 $3 10 ) 
#( $2 $3 2 ) #( $2 $4 4 ) #( $2 $5 8 ) 
#( $3 $5 9 ) #( $4 $6 10 )
#( $5 $4 6 ) #( $5 $6 10 )).
